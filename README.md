# reweb
re:Web enables classic web applications to run on AWS Lambda.

re:Web interfaces with the Lambda Runtime API and provides a translation layer from API Gateway requests to the HTTP service running inside the container.
This allows to run common web applications like Wordpress in a truly serverless and request-based way. No more paying full price for halfway idle web
servers / containers!
